Capstone Project - NLP Applications:
A Python program that is developed to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews.

The program can be installed on your device and saved in any of your files.

If you use VSCode, you can just open a new terminal and run it.

I would like to thank HyperionDev for giving me the opportunity to do this project.
