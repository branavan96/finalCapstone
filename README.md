### 1 - Description of Project
A Python program that is developed to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of consumers's reviews of products. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and analysed by Python. 

### 2- Installation Information 
Once you've seen the 'sentiment_analysis.py' file in this repository, click on the file to view it. After you've seen the code, click on the button on the top right with three dots, which has a drop-down menu. On the menu, it has a 'Download' option, and you choose that option. After the file is downloaded, it can be seen in the 'Downloads' file on your local device for you to view again. 

### 3 - Usage Instructions
If you use VSCode, you go to the 'Open' section to load the file. As well as this file, go to the Amazon Consumer Reviews dataset on Kaggle and download it. Once the dataset is downloaded, we rename it 'amazon_product_reviews' in order for the data to be read in the program. After you have done that, you can run the program to give you the results you are looking for. Here are some photos of the project in action.

### 4 - Credits
Most of the credit goes to the members of the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp team for giving us the opportunity to do this project. This project wouldn't have been completed without the guidance they provided during this period.
