## Capstone Project - NLP Applications
### Description of Project
A Python program that is developed to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of consumer's reviews of products. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and analysed by Python. 

### Installation Information 
Once you've seen the 'sentiment_analysis.py' file in this repository, click on the file to view it. After you've seen the code, click on the button on the top right with three dots which has a dropdown menu. On the menu, it has a 'Download' option and you choose that option. After the file is downloaded, it can be seen in the 'Downloads' file on your local device for you to view to again. 

### User's Instructions
If you use VSCode, you go to the 'Open' section to load the file. As well as this file, go to the Amazon Consumer Reviews dataset on Kaggle and download it. Once it is downloaded, you rename it 'amazon_product_reviews' in order for the data to be read in the program. After you have done that, you can run the program to give you the results you are looking for. Here are some processes and outputs of the program.
